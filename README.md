## Docker Tags

- `<year>-<month>-<day>-<a short string>`: Each merge to master generates an image tagged with the date of its build followed by a short git SHA. These images are suitable for pinning to if you do not wish to live on the edge with `4.x`. Changes from one image to the next will include things shown in the [commit history](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-dev-tools/commits/master) on GitHub and updated operating system packages pulled in at build time.
- `<year>-<month>-<day>-<a short string>-rootless`: This is just like the tag above but the container runs as a user named `puppetdev`.
- `4.x`: This the tag that is shipped by default in CD4PE. This tag is updated manually from time to time.
- `latest`: This is a legacy tag and not not actually the current build of puppet-dev-tools. It is the build used in older versions of CD4PE (prior to 4.0). These builds are manually created by the CD4PE team.
- `puppet8`: This tag contains tooling updates to support Puppet 8. Use this image if you want to test code that has been updated for Puppet 8. This tag is updated manually from time to time.

## Running

This container is designed to run commands against control repos or modules that you want to test. It assumes that the repo code is mounted to /repo inside the container. To run test commands, from the root of a repo you want to test, run  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo puppet/puppet-dev-tools <command> where <command> is any of the ones listed below.

## Supported Commands

1. PDK - `pdk`
   - run `docker run --rm puppet/puppet-dev-tools:puppet8 pdk --help` to see builtin help
   - see the [PDK command reference](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pdk/3.x/pdk_reference.html) for details
2. Onceover - `onceover`
   - run `docker run --rm puppet/puppet-dev-tools:puppet8 onceover --help` to see builtin help
   - see [Onceover's readme](https://github.com/dylanratcliffe/onceover/blob/master/README.md) for details
3. Rake tasks from the installed gems (see below)
   - run a single rake task like so: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo puppet/puppet-dev-tools:puppet8 rake -f /Rakefile lint`
   - run multiple rake tasks sequentially like so: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo puppet/puppet-dev-tools:puppet8 rake -f /Rakefile lint syntax yamllint`

### A note on Onceover usage

If your control repository contains a Gemfile you will likely want to modify the commands listed above to something like this:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo puppet/puppet-dev-tools:puppet8 \
/bin/bash -c "bundle install && bundle exec onceover run spec --force --trace --parallel"
```
